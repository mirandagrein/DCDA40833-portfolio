            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> In this course, I hope to strengthen my skills in data analysis and digital culture tools such as web design, while building a portfolio that accurately reflects my abilities. I am excited to use this capstone course to create a creative project that showcases what I've learned throughout the semester. </p>
