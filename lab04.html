            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This lab uses Tableau Public to explore and analyze a dataset through interactive data visualization. I chose the dataset, “Airline Fight Routes in The US [1993-2024],” to explore trends within route popularity, route fares over time, and average passenger trends, concerning flights to and from the DFW airport.</p>

            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>The data for this project included year, airport IDs, departure and arrival cities, the distance in miles between the origin and arrival cities, average number of passengers flying this route per day, and average fare. An issue that arose while working with the data was the lack of coordinates for airports in the dataset which is crucial for map visualizations. This was fixed by combining a dataset with longitude and latitude data for each airport code using the excel function, Xlookup. In addition, preparing the data for the map was crucial to represent each route. Some techniques used were creating calculated fields with corresponding longitude and latitude coordinates for departures and arrivals as well as combining duplicate routes into a count system instead of an overlap. The data was also filtered to include routes which solely included departures or arrivals to the DFW airport.</p>

            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p>The map was designed to emphasize the spread of DFW routes across the country along with an identification of the population of these routes. This was achieved by using the count of average passengers for each route to darken the color of high frequency flights with a high average count of passengers and vice versa with a lighter color for a lower average. The airports are labeled and pinpointed across the country to demonstrate a geographical view of  flight routes and connectivity to and from DFW. </p> <p> The next visualization exhibits the count of average passengers in a bar chart with color coordination which corresponds to average fare of the flight route. This was intentionally constructed to identify possible patterns between frequently flown flight routes and price as viewers would easily recognize similar colors in a similar vertical position in the chart. Other patterns by price were documented through the histogram of flights. This histogram demonstrates the average fare of each of the highest average passenger routes through a single line for each. The second histogram represents the average passenger over time aligning with the flight fares histogram. This design choice was made to allow viewers to identify possible patterns in the direction and slope of the lines over years. It was important to only use the top passenger flights as using all would make the graph cluttered and using low passenger flights would allow too much variability.</p>

            <h3>Expected patterns</h3>
            <p>One of the main identified patterns was present in the histogram. This pattern indicated all flights having decreasing fares during 2001 and 2020 as well as significantly less average passengers. This was an expected pattern due to the events of 9/11 and covid, and as the events happened, less passengers were flying, thus the prices lowered.</p>
            <p>Another expected pattern was high average passenger routes had lower average fares. It would be expected that lower fares connecting major cities would be flown more frequently as the convenience of a lower fare flight outweighs other methods of transportation.</p>

            <h3>Surprises/Outliers</h3>
            <p>A surprise observed was the lack of a correlation or pattern between further flight routes and higher fare. Originally, I expected that further flights would cost more and shorter flights would be cheaper. However, the corresponding fares for each route differed regardless of the distance. </p>
            <p>An outlier identified was the flight from DFW to TSS. This route's average fare was more than three times larger than every other route's average fare. The bar chart fare color coordination indicator had to be altered to ignore this outlier as it threw off the scale of every other route’s color</p>
            <h3>Questions for further investigation</h3>
            <p>Some questions to explore this data more could include, “How are flight routes priced,” “Do routes with fewer airlines operating have higher fares,” “Does seasonality or quarter affect average fares,” and “Do geographic distance or travel time affect route frequency?” These questions could explore more about airline data and explore more trends that were not included in the visualizations made.</p>

            <h3>Tool evaluation</h3>
            <p>Tableau as a visualization tool has many advantages over other softwares. Creating visualizations in tools such as Python and Excel has limits such as less creative freedom with formatting, using different fonts and graphics, and lack of shareable dashboards. Excel has limited formats for visualizations and making complex visualizations with excel functions is a hassle. Python as well has visualizations, but they also lack variety unless paired with additional packages. Still, sharing visualizations in Python is more complex than Tableau. The implementation of dashboards is a highlight for Tableau as it was easy to share and embed in html code. The dashboards made are able to be shared instantaneously and retain their interactivity. However, Tableau had a few downsides that created a few difficulties. One of these was the lack of customization for the map. The colors in the background did not suit the map visualization the way that was envisioned when brainstorming. There were around six preset options, three of which were too cluttered, and the other few clashed with the points and lines. Another issue with Tableau was the implementation of the visualizations within the dashboard. There was a lack of options regarding the size of the dashboard which the first size chosen ended up clashing with the embedded code, so the size had to be changed. However, these downsides do not diminish the advantages of Tableau.</p>
