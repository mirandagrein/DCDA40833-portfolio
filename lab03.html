            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The visualization, “Homicides are Falling Around the World” presents a graphic showing eight countries alongside a labeled percentage decrease from 1995-2015. The graphic is quick to comprehend, but its information resolution is surprisingly low. This critique serves to look into real-world data visualizations and critically evaluate the intergrity and quality of visual arguments</p>
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>Information resolution concerns how much of the underlying evidence is made visible to the viewer. Regarding the visualization, “Homicides are Falling Around the World,” the information resolution is less than what would be considered ideal. The graphic labels only eight countries, without stating how those countries were selected, if they are representative, or how many countries were excluded. The title claims a global trend, yet there is uncontextualized evidence shown and lacks the necessary components to support its claim. This raises questions to the viewer about completeness and validity of this assertion. If the case is that homicide rates declined in only these eight countries, then the claim is misleading and not representative of what would be considered a “global trend.” On the other hand, if many other countries also experienced a decline, the omission of these countries on the graphic would also withhold information to the viewer. In this case, the unnamed countries would be significant in determining if there is, in fact, a global decline. Say if the missing countries were mostly in one continent with only a few outliers, the claim that homicides are falling globally would be misleading, as the countries would need to be equally dispersed in each continent. Another concern would be the population of the missing countries. A country with an insignificant population would not be an ideal deciding factor in global rates versus a high population country. In all cases, the visualization fails to disclose the size or structure of the underlying dataset, leaving the reader unable to judge the scope of the claim.  </p>
            <p>Accompanying the visualization is an article in which a short summary is presented in regard to the content in the visualization, followed by proposed reasoning as to why homicides are declining. The graphic is missing reasoning or data to share why homicide rates are declining which was shared in the article. It would be important, as the article provides reasons why homicides are declining, to share the data used to state these reasons, and present these findings on the visualization. </p>
            <h3>"Rage to Conclude"</h3>
            <p>In the reading, “Corruption in Evidence Presentations: Effects without Causes, Cherry-Picking, Overreaching, Chartjunk, and the Rage to Conclude,” from <em>Beautiful Evidence</em> by Edward Tufte, Tufte identifies a few ways that presentations and visualizations produce corrupt assertions that deceive the audience from the truth. One example, Tufte describes as “Rage to Conclude,” in which complex ideas and strong claims are presented with neat conclusions, unsupported by proportional evidence (Tufte, 2006, p.154).</p>
            <p>The claim that homicides are decreasing globally is a significant statement and one that is a concrete example of Tufte's idea of the “Rage to Conclude.” Homicide data is especially difficult to collect and compare across countries over the span of years due to underreporting, inconsistent legal definitions, and differences in processes and technology due to advancing time-periods. None of these limitations are acknowledged in the graphic. The complexity is flattened into a bold conclusion, producing a neat narrative rather than identifying the uncertainty inherent in the data.</p>
            <h3>"Cherry-Picking"</h3>
            <p>Another one of Tufte's concepts, “Cherry-Picking,” is present when conclusions are formed by filtering through data and publishing what is personally deemed as relevant evidence that supports a specific claim, and is also present in this visualization, (Tufte, 2006, p. 144-145). The viewer is shown only favorable instances that support the desired narrative of global improvement by less homicides. There are no shown instances of countries with an increasing homicide rate or a proportion of countries with increasing versus decreasing homicide. A way to combat “Cherry-Picking” would be to publish all of the rates of change of homicides, including increases in homicides, and allow viewers to examine the evidence themselves rather than pointing them toward a predetermined conclusion.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, the visualization “Homicides are Falling Around the World” exemplifies little information resolution and withholds necessary information from the viewer. It presents a broad, global claim without sharing the data that was used to reach this claim, any contradicting evidence, or more than a few countries that would indicate if this claim is a valid global claim. The “Rage to Conclude” is present in this visualization as a complex issue, homicide rates, is summarized and decided that it has decreased, without sufficient, clear evidence. There is also “Cherry-Picking” as not every country was included, and select high decreasing rates were mainly highlighted. A higher-resolution approach would disclose all data, acknowledge uncertainty, and let the viewer determine if the evidence is sufficient enough to determine the true changing rate of homicide.</p>
